# Text Analyzer & Converter

This is my first attempt at building something in CoffeeScript.  It will take user-defined text and compute the following statistics:

- Total number of characters
- Total number of words
- Average word length
- Longest word
- Most frequently occuring character

It will then convert the text into a smaller format, more suitable for character-limited formats (i.e. Twitter).  The conversion will shorten/ abbreviate the following:

- States ("Florida" --> "FL")
- Streets ("Street" --> "St")
- Internet Slang ("Thank You" --> "ty")
- Days/Months ("February" --> "Feb")
- Units of Measurement ("Pounds" --> "lbs")
- And more
